                        <strong>Hi babe! ðŸ¥°</strong>
                        <p>
                           It's been two months since the last time we saw each other, and We haven't been able to celebrate our birthdays together. 
                           But I also know that You're not a fan of it, so the only reason I'm writting this message is to remind You that if You're 
                           going to running through my mind all day, at least put on some clothes. Happy Valentine's Day! ðŸ˜˜
                        </p>
